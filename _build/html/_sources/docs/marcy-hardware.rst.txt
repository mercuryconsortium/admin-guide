Marcy Hardware
==============

Marcy was acquired in 2013 and is hosted at the Furman University's data center:

    | Furman ITS
    | Montague Village
    | 2600 Duncan Chapel Rd.
    | Greenville, SC 29617

The main contacts at Furman ITS are:

    | Dexter Caldwell - dexter.caldwell@furman.edu

A diagram of Marcy's hardware
configuration is presented below. The numbers on the left side of the cluster identify slots. For
each node, the node name is given first, followed by the processors, memory, and hard disk space.
Slots 1U - 24U house nodes while slots 41U - 42U house network switches.

To physically access Marcy, contact Dexter Caldwell to schedule a visit
to Montague Village. Once at the facility, the rack itself must be opened with a key - which Togo
has currently.
